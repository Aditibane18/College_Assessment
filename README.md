## Question 1
You are tasked with developing a Python program to suggest search query completions based on a user's search history. The program should efficiently find completions using a any search algorithm.

Input:
search_history = [
        "apple",
        "banana",
        "carrot",
        "pear",
        "pineapple",
        "potato",
        "strawberry"
    ]

Output:
Enter your partial search query: p
Suggestions:
pear
pineapple
potato

## Question 2
Given two strings ‘str1’ and ‘str2’ of size m and n respectively. The task is to remove/delete and insert the minimum number of characters from/in str1 to transform it into str2. It could be possible that the same character needs to be removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted at some another point.

Example 1:
Input :
str1 = "heap", str2 = "pea"
Output :
Minimum Deletion = 2 and
Minimum Insertion = 1
